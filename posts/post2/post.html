<h2 id="step-1-power-delivery-and-system-voltage-regulation"><strong>Step 1: Power Delivery and System Voltage Regulation</strong></h2>
<h3 id="power-button-pressed-–-initial-electrical-activation"><strong>Power Button Pressed – Initial Electrical Activation</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</strong> is responsible for converting <strong>Alternating Current (AC)</strong> from a wall outlet into <strong>Direct Current (DC)</strong> voltages suitable for computer components. Even before the power button is pressed, a small <strong>standby voltage (5VSB)</strong> is continuously supplied by the PSU to power essential circuits, including the motherboard’s power management logic, USB wake functions, and wake-on-LAN features.</p>
<h3 id="cmos-battery-and-pre-power-state"><strong>CMOS Battery and Pre-Power State</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The motherboard contains a <strong>CMOS battery</strong>, a coin-cell lithium battery that powers the <strong>Real-Time Clock (RTC)</strong> and retains system firmware settings when the computer is powered off.</li>
<li>The <strong>BIOS/UEFI firmware chip</strong>, stored in <strong>SPI flash memory</strong>, is non-volatile and does not require power from the CMOS battery except for maintaining clock and configuration settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-power-on-sequence"><strong>Full Power-On Sequence</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Pressing the power button triggers the <strong>power-on signal (PS-ON#)</strong>, instructing the PSU to fully activate and supply its primary output voltages: <strong>+12V, +5V, and +3.3V</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>24-pin ATX connector</strong> delivers these voltages to the motherboard, ensuring power reaches the CPU, chipset, RAM, and peripheral slots.</li>
<li>The <strong>EPS 8-Pin CPU power connector</strong> supplies <strong>+12V</strong> directly to the motherboard’s <strong>Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs)</strong>, which step down the voltage to the precise level required by the CPU (typically <strong>1.1V–1.5V</strong>).</li>
<li>The <strong>Power Good (PG) signal</strong> is sent by the PSU to indicate that stable voltages are available. Until this signal is received, the CPU remains in a <strong>reset state</strong>, held by the <strong>Reset# line</strong> (an active-low signal that prevents execution).</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-cpu-initialization-and-reset-vector-execution"><strong>Step 2: CPU Initialization and Reset Vector Execution</strong></h2>
<h3 id="how-the-cpu-begins-execution"><strong>How the CPU Begins Execution</strong></h3>
<p>Upon receiving the <strong>Power Good signal</strong>, the CPU exits its reset state and begins execution. However, at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAM is uninitialized and cannot be used</strong>.</li>
<li>The CPU has no access to the operating system or storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPU begins execution at a fixed address known as the <strong>reset vector</strong>, a predefined location mapped to the system firmware. This address is configured to point to the <strong>BIOS/UEFI firmware</strong>, which resides in an SPI-based non-volatile memory chip on the motherboard.</p>
<h3 id="memory-mapping-and-instruction-fetching"><strong>Memory Mapping and Instruction Fetching</strong></h3>
<p>Since RAM is unavailable at this stage, an intercept mechanism is required to provide the CPU with executable instructions. The motherboard chipset redirects access to the reset vector and maps it to the <strong>SPI flash firmware chip</strong>, ensuring the CPU can fetch its first instruction.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):</strong> A legacy firmware interface operating in <strong>16-bit real mode</strong>, using <strong>MBR-based booting</strong>, and relying on interrupt-driven I/O.</li>
<li><strong>UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):</strong> A modern replacement for BIOS, operating in <strong>32-bit or 64-bit mode</strong>, supporting <strong>GPT booting</strong>, secure boot, graphical interfaces, and faster boot times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="core-responsibilities-of-biosuefi"><strong>Core Responsibilities of BIOS/UEFI</strong></h3>

<h3 id="mbr-booting-legacy-bios"><strong>MBR Booting (Legacy BIOS)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Master Boot Record (MBR)</strong> resides in the first 512 bytes of a bootable disk and contains:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>bootloader</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>partition table</strong> defining disk layout.</li>
<li>A <strong>signature (0x55AA)</strong> that identifies it as a valid MBR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The BIOS loads the bootloader into RAM and executes it, which then loads the operating system kernel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uefi-booting"><strong>UEFI Booting</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>UEFI stores <strong>boot entries</strong> in <strong>NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM)</strong>, which contain paths to EFI bootloaders.</li>
<li>Instead of MBR, UEFI systems use <strong>GPT (GUID Partition Table)</strong>, which supports larger storage devices and advanced boot mechanisms.</li>
<li>The bootloader is executed directly from the <strong>EFI System Partition (ESP)</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Device Driver Initialization:</strong> The kernel loads essential drivers for storage, networking, and input devices.</li>
<li><strong>Interrupt Handling Setup:</strong> The <strong>Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)</strong> is established, mapping interrupts to their respective <strong>Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Daemon Initialization:</strong> Background processes (e.g., system loggers, networking daemons) start execution.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="interrupt-handling-and-device-input"><strong>Interrupt Handling and Device Input</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interrupts</strong> allow peripherals (such as keyboards and mice) to signal the CPU without constant polling.</li>
<li>The <strong>Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC/APIC)</strong> prioritizes interrupt requests and forwards them to the CPU.</li>
<li>The CPU pauses its current task and executes the corresponding ISR to process the event.</li>

<li>The kernel launches <strong>user-space services</strong> such as the graphical display manager and login screen.</li>
<li>The <strong>init system</strong> (e.g., <code>systemd</code> on Linux, <code>wininit.exe</code> on Windows) orchestrates service startup.</li>
<li>The system becomes interactive, allowing user applications to run.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="role-of-daemons-and-device-management"><strong>Role of Daemons and Device Management</strong></h3>
